            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>UV exposure is an important risk factor for burns, redness and skin cancer. People's knowledge of sun exposure and protection is often inadequate. Additionally, current communication of UV data through media campaigns has proven ineffective
                at improving sun protection, and current solutions for measuring UV exposure are costly and inconvenient. While UV exposure is cna be risky, the methods of reducing of UV exposure are simple, such as wearing long-sleeve clothing or applying
                sunscreen regularly. </p>
            <p>Based on this problem, <b>our purpose</b> is to increase people's awareness of their UV dosage and exposure. In order to do so, <b>our goals</b> are to design and build mobile app that measures UV exposure of the user and presents the information
                in an understandable format and to evaluate how our system helps users better estimate their UV exposure. </p>
