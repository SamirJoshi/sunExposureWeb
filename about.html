            <h1> About Us </h1>
            The SunExposure app was created by 4 students at Northwestern University, through the Wireless and Mobile Health Course, over the duration of approximately 3 months. INSERT IMAGES HERE
            <h1> Thanks! </h1>
            We'd like to acknowledge and thank Tammy Stump, our faculty advisor for this project, for her help and guidance in understanding the problem and advising us on the feature of the SunExposure app. Tammy, as well as Shade, allowed us to compare how our
            app performed with an existing wearable UV sensor. We'd also like to thank Professor Nabil Alshurafa, and our TAs Shibo Zhang and Dzung Nguyen for all of their assistance and guidance over the course of the project and for the final report.
            Finally, we'd like to thank the HABits Lab, for sponsoring this project and providing us with the tools necessary to create and test our app and system.
